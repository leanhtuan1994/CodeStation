s:982:"<p>If multiple attempts are allowed, this setting specifies whether the highest, average (mean), first or last completed attempt is recorded in the gradebook. The last completed attempt option does not include attempts with a 'failed' status.</p>

<p>Notes on handling of multiple attempts:</p>

<ul><li>The option to start a new attempt is provided by a checkbox above the Enter button on the content structure page, so be sure you're providing access to that page if you want to allow more than one attempt.</li>
<li>Some SCORM packages are intelligent about new attempts, many are not. What this means is that if the learner re-enters an existing attempt, if the SCORM content does not have internal logic to avoid overwriting previous attempts they can be overwritten, even though the attempt was 'completed' or 'passed'.</li>
<li>The settings "Force completed", "Force new attempt" and "Lock after final attempt" also provide further management of multiple attempts.</li>
</ul>";
