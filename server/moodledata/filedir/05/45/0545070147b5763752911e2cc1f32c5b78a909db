		<content>Your First Java Program class MyClass {   public static void main(String[ ] args) {     System.out.println(&amp;quot;Hello World&amp;quot;);   } } As a summary: - Every program in Java must have a class. - Every Java program starts from the main method. In Java, every line of code that can actually run needs to be inside a class. In our example, we named the class MyClass. You will learn more about classes in the upcoming modules. In Java, each application has an entry point, or a starting point, which is a method called main. Along with main, the keywords public and static will also be explained later.

		<content>The main Method&amp;#x0A;To run our program, the main method must be identical to this signature:  public: anyone can access it - static: method can be run without creating an instance of the class containing the main method - void: method doesn't return any value - main: the name of the method public static void main(String[ ] args) The method's parameters are declared inside the parentheses that follow the name of the method.  For main, it's an array of strings called args. We will use it in our next lesson, so don't worry if you don't understand it all now.
