		<title>Java Comments</title>
		<content>Java Comments The purpose of including comments in your code is to explain what the code is doing. Java supports both single and multi-line comments. All characters that appear within a comment are ignored by the Java compiler. A single-line comment starts with two forward slashes and continues until it reaches the end of the line. // this is a single-line comment x = 5; // a single-line comment after code Adding comments as you write code is a good practice, because they provide clarification and understanding when you need to refer back to it, as well as for others who might need to read it.

		<title>Multi-Line Comments</title>
		<content>Multi-Line Comments Java also supports comments that span multiple lines. You start this type of comment with a forward slash followed by an asterisk, and end it with an asterisk followed by a forward slash.  For example: /*  This is also a     comment spanning     multiple lines */ Note that Java does not support nested multi-line comments.  However, you can nest single-line comments within multi-line comments. /* This is a single-line comment:     // a single-line comment  */ Multi-Line Comments Java also supports comments that span multiple lines. You start this type of comment with a forward slash followed by an asterisk, and end it with an asterisk followed by a forward slash.  For example: /*  This is also a     comment spanning     multiple lines */ Note that Java does not support nested multi-line comments.  However, you can nest single-line comments within multi-line comments. /* This is a single-line comment:     // a single-line comment  */ </content>

		<title>Documentation Comments</title>
		<content>Documentation Comments Documentation comments are special comments that have the appearance of multi-line comments, with the difference being that they generate external documentation of your source code. These begin with a forward slash followed by two asterisks, and end with an asterisk followed by a forward slash.  /** This is a documentation comment */ /** This is also a     documentation comment */ Javadoc is a tool which comes with JDK and it is used for generating Java code documentation in HTML format from Java source code which has required documentation in a predefined format.
