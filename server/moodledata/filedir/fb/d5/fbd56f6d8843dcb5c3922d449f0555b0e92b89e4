		<content>Variables Variables store data for processing. A variable is given a name (or identifier), such as area, age, height, and the like. The name uniquely identifies each variable, assigning a value to the variable and retrieving the value stored Variables have types. Some examples: - int: for integers (whole numbers) such as 123 and -456 - double: for floating-point or real numbers with optional decimal points and fractional parts in fixed or scientific notations, such as 3.1416, -55.66. - String: for texts such as &amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Good Morning!&amp;quot;. Text strings are enclosed within double quotes Variables Variables store data for processing. A variable is given a name (or identifier), such as area, age, height, and the like.

		<content>You can declare a variable of a type and assign it a value. Example: String name = &amp;quot;David&amp;quot;; This creates a variable called name of type String, and assigns it the value &amp;quot;David&amp;quot;. It is important to note that a variable is associated with a type, and is only capable of storing values of that particular type. For example, an int variable can store integer values, such as 123; but it cannot store real numbers, such as 12.34, or texts, such as &amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot;.
